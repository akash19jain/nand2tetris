# nand2tetris

## Implementation of a complete computer from Nand gates on up as described in the book, "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken.  

### PROJECT 01:  
Building the Chipset That will be later used to construct the COmputer's Arithmetic Logic Unit and Memory System.  
The following Chipsets were built with NAND as the Primitive Gate.  
1. And  
2. Or  
3. Xor  
4. Mux  
5. DMux  
6. Not16  
7. And16  
8. Or16  
9. Mux16  
10. Or8Way  
11. Mux4Way16  
12. Mux8Way16  
13. DMux4Way  
14. DMux8Way  
15. Not  
The `.hdl` (Hardware Descriptor Language) file contains the code for the chipset and the `.out` file contains the output for the corresponding chipsets.
